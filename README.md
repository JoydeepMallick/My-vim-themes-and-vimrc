## Gvim and vim users   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/vim/vim-original.svg" alt="vim" width="35" height="35"/> targeted, for my neovim config visit [here](https://github.com/JoydeepMallick/My-Neovim-config-in-LUA)
It contains the colors folder and autoload folder and also my personal .vimrc files. 

The **minimal vimrc** file has no additional plugins and a very minimalistic setting with remapped keys to run programs in most common programming languages.

The **ultimate vimrc** has plugins to make it get the most of vim for power users.

Hope you like my personal taste of themes.😀

## ***PREREQUISITES***
### For minimal vimrc
Be sure to copy color and autoload folder in vim directory.

### For ultimate vimrc
Be sure to install Vim-Plug, To know how to install it please visit [Vim-Plug repository](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug). Then simply copy the contents of ultimate vimrc folder to the .vimrc file present there(probably) in the ```C:\Users\YourUserName\ ``` directory or rather ```%HOME%``` directory .  More detailed instructions in the [readme file](https://github.com/JoydeepMallick/My-vim-themes-and-vimrc/blob/main/vimrcs/ultimate_vimrc/readme.md).

## ***INSTALLATION & USAGE***
Simply navigate to the vimrcs folder and choose the .vimrc file of your choice and copy it into your .vimrc config. More instructions in the readme.

For e.g. (Windows users taken into focus, sorry😅) if you have vim9.x installed in ```C:\Users\YourUserName\ProgramFiles\vim9x\``` then simply copy and paste the color and autoload folder in the installation folder for vim ``` C:\Users\YourUserName\ProgramFiles\vim9x\ ```(only applicable for minimal vimrc since we didn't use any plugins to install stuff) and paste the .vimrc file in ``` C:\Users\YourUserName\ ``` directory or rather ```%HOME%``` directory.




**I am eager to get more suggestions....🤓**
