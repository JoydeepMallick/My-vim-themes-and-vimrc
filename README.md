# My-vim-themes-and-vimrc
It contains the colors folder and autoload folder and also my personal .vimrc file. It has no additional plugins and a very minimalistic setting with remapped keys to run programs in most common programming languages.

## Usage
Simply copy and paste the color and autoload folder in the installation folder for vim ``` C:\Users\User\ProgramFiles\vim9x\ ```
and paste the .vimrc file in ``` C:\Users\User\ ``` directory.

Hope you like my personal taste of themes and my personal .vimrc file.😀


***Note***
The vimrc file can be directly copied into your vimrc config, I have just renamed from **".vimrc"** to **"vimrc"** for the purpose of uploading it(Hidden file could,nt be uploaded).
Hence just rename it as per need if you use the file directly.
