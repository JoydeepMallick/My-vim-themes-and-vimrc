# My-vim-themes-and-vimrc
#### Gvim and vim users   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/vim/vim-original.svg" alt="vim" width="45" height="45"/> targeted, for my neovim config visit [here](https://github.com/JoydeepMallick/My-Neovim-config-in-LUA)
It contains the colors folder and autoload folder and also my personal .vimrc files. 
The **minimal vimrc** file has no additional plugins and a very minimalistic setting with remapped keys to run programs in most common programming languages.
The **ultimate vimrc** has plugins to make it get the most of vim for power users.

## Below are few screenshot(s) of my minimal .vimrc:-

Hope you like my personal taste of themes.üòÄ

## ***PREREQUISITES***
### For minimal vimrc
Be sure to copy color and autoload folder in vim directory.

### For ultimate vimrc
Be sure to install Vim-Plug, To know how to install it please visit [Vim-Plug repository](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug). Then simply copy the contents of ultimate vimrc folder to ```C:\Users\User\ ``` directory in the .vimrc file present there(probably).

## ***INSTALLATION & USAGE***
Simply navigate to the vimrcs folder and choose the .vimrc file of your choice and copy it into your .vimrc config.

For e.g. (Windows users taken into focus, sorryüòÖ) if you have vim9.x installed in ```C:\Users\User\ProgramFiles\vim9x\``` then simply copy and paste the color and autoload folder in the installation folder for vim ``` C:\Users\User\ProgramFiles\vim9x\ ```(only applicable for minimal vimrc since we didn't use any plugins to install stuff) and paste the .vimrc file in ``` C:\Users\User\ ``` directory.




** I am eager to get more suggestions....ü§ì **
