# My-vim-themes-and-vimrc
It contains the colors folder and autoload folder and also my personal .vimrc file. It has no additional plugins and a very minimalistic setting with remapped keys to run programs in most common programming languages.

## Below are few screenshot(s) of my minimal .vimrc:-

Hope you like my personal taste of themes(Don't forget about the themes plugin🔥😍 with 1000+ themes in my ultimate vimrc).😀

## ***PREREQUISITES***
#### For minimal vimrc
Be sure to copy color and autoload folder in vim directory.

#### For ultimate vimrc
Be sure to install Vim-Plug, To know how to install it please visit [Vim-Plug repository](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

## ***INSTALLATION & USAGE***
Simply navigate to the vimrcs folder and choose the .vimrc file of your choice and copy it into your .vimrc config.

For e.g. if you have vim9.x installed in ```C:\Users\User\ProgramFiles\vim9x\``` then simply copy and paste the color and autoload folder in the installation folder for vim ``` C:\Users\User\ProgramFiles\vim9x\ ```(only applicable for minimal vimrc since we didn't use any plugins to install stuff) and paste the .vimrc file in ``` C:\Users\User\ ``` directory.
