Hope you like my personal taste of themes and my personal .vimrc file.😀


***Note***
The vimrc file can be directly copied into your vimrc config, I have just renamed from **".vimrc"** to **"vimrc"** for the purpose of uploading it(Hidden file could,nt be uploaded).
Hence just rename it as per need if you use the file directly.
