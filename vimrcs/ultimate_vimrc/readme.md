## Setup Instructions:

1. Open the `%HOME%` directory of Windows. To locate the home directory, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Windows</kbd> and then type `%HOME%`. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to open your home directory.

2. Check if a `.vimrc` file is present in the home directory. If not, create a new `.vimrc` file and copy the contents of my `.vimrc` into it.

3. Ensure that the vim-plug plugin manager is installed. If not, visit their [GitHub page](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) and follow the installation guidelines.

4. Run PlugInstall. Open gvim or vim, then type `:PlugInstall` in the vim command line and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

5. The necessary packages will be installed and ready to use.

6. Customize the `.vimrc` file according to your preferences. Feel free to contact me if you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement.

#### If stuck , ```:help``` in vim comes to the rescueðŸ¥º most of the times, read documentation, learnt it from experience.

### Update:

I have added a modified_startify.vim folder that is sourced within the `.vimrc` file itself. Copy it to your desired location and *edit the location accordingly* in the modified startup section of my `.vimrc`. ðŸ™‚

By default, I have set it to be present in the home directory, so there should be no need to modify the code.

If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
